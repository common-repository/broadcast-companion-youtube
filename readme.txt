This plugin is for use with the Broadcast Lite theme and provides the youtube.com API functionality.

== Description ==

Broadcast Companion, used in combination with the theme [Broadcast Lite](https://wordpress.org/themes/broadcast-lite/) or [Broadcast PRO](https://www.streamweasels.com/twitch-wordpress-themes/broadcast-pro/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=broadcast-companion-youtube&utm_campaign=readme) will integrate YouTube data into your theme. Every time your website is loaded, this plugin makes a request to YouTube to check if you are online. If you are online, data from YouTube is presented in the theme. 

The following data is displayed from YouTube:

* Online / Offline status from Twitch
* Active game / category
* Viewer count
* Videos

=== Setup ===

This plugin keeps an active connection to the YouTube API, which requires you to add a YouTube API key. Instructions on where to find this data are included in the plugin, but you can also find those instructions [here](https://support.streamweasels.com/article/26-how-to-setup-a-youtube-api-key).
